    // Otherwise I believe I would have had one different list when creating a prompt and when using the option of appending new prompt (stretch challenge);
    // Because I would have created two instances within each method, I needed to be the same instance, so is a member variable.
    // Also I do not know if It's a good practice to not use parameters it feels like calling global variables, is weird, a large system design would be madness.

        I could Get a prompt from a Prompt class method or get a random one from a Prompt list as a member variable here (It ended as a class);
        Get a list with two strings inside from public list<String> GetEntry(string Prompt) and and pass them to the newEntry instance inside public void WriteEntry();
        Get a string from string GetDateFromSystem() and pass it to the newEntry instance;
        Pass those three strings to AppendToList(date, prompt, userAnswer)
        Or I could just do all that inside WriteEntry() and save me time and effort;
        I will go the lazy way, please correct me if it should have been the other way.*/
